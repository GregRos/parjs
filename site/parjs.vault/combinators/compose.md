#stage-4

This #ğŸš€booster  is found on all [[combinator|combinators]]. Itâ€™s similar to the [[pipe]] tuner. Instead of applying a series of combinators to a parser, it composes multiple combinators together so they can be applied as a single combinator.

```ts title:compose.ts
import {map, each} from "parjs"
const composed = map(x => x + 1).compose(
    each(console.log)
)
```

This [[booster]] emulates the function composition operator found in many functional languages.
